    <h3>Discover which hashtags other people use! ðŸš€</h3><p>
                 I was always curious which hashtag groups were being used the most. That's why we put a "Discover" section in the app! Just click "Discover" section at the bottom (1) There are "Trending', "Popular", and "New" hashtag groups. We look at how many times a hashtag group is copied and saved by other users to calculate these lists every day (2). Trending hashtag groups are copied and saved recently a lot more than usual.
                </p> <br>

     <p>Navigate through other tabs at the top. Click "Popular" (3) to see the most copied and saved hashtag groups in the app. "New" section shows the hashtag groups generated most recently by other users. All of these lists are refreshed daily to show you the most recent data!

                 Aaaand here our Preset Hashtags section! We curated the best hashtags sorted by category. Sometimes it is hard to guess what hashtags you want to use. Just click "Presets" (4) at the bottom to see 30+ categories of hashtags. Let's try one to see what they have by clicking "Sport" section (5)

       <p>There are lots of sport hashtags focused on different aspects of sports. Here we see Running, Swimming, Fitness, and many more. You can just click (6) any hashtag you want to collect. These hashtags will be collected on your hashtag pool (7) so you can copy or save them!
                </p> <br>

       <p>I hope hashtags are helping you on social media as they are helping thousands of others! If you have any problems or questions about hashtags, just send me an email in the app! I will be happy to assist :)
